title: When Your Significant Other<br>Has Bipolar Disorder
---

I was recently asked a question on Twitter about being in a romantic relationship with someone diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder. Below is the original question and my response.

> My partner of 11 months was diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder (1) 6 months ago. We have argued quiet a bit recently, but even before the diagnosis we argued a bit about what I thought was trivial stuff and it has just worn me out. I don’t have the love I felt for her or the patience for it anymore. It’s not fair on her either but I feel selfish and guilty. We live together and have been arguing the past few days and I think it’s best that we break up for both our sakes as I don’t have empathy (not just for her) and I’m not a big talker about emotions and that. I just feel really lost.

I think it’s very common to feel lost and confused when someone significant in your life is diagnosed with any mental illness. As a society, we don’t really give mental illness the time of day, so a diagnosis can seem very scary for everyone involved.

First, I think it’s very common to feel lost and confused when someone significant in your life is diagnosed with any mental illness. As a society, we don’t really give mental illness the time of day, so a diagnosis can seem very scary for everyone involved. It’s worth noting that there is a good chance she is feeling many of the same emotions that you are. Because the nature of Bipolar Disorder is so unstable, I spend a lot of time trying to figure out if there was some specific trigger that cause a depressive or manic episode. Honestly, I rarely find a trigger, which leaves me dazed and confused. Bipolar Disorder 1 is far more intense than any other form of the disease and I imagine handling the mood swings can be really challenging and tiring. I fight exhaustion on a regular basis, as I’m sure anyone does who is affected so deeply by Bipolar Disorder; be it the diagnosed or those surrounding them.

A cornerstone to any relationship is communication. Tell your significant other how you feel. It’s always better to put all the cards on the table for both of you to see. Imagine that your emotional state is a radio wave coming from your iPhone, it has peaks and it has valleys. Maybe it looks like this:

small-wave

For a person suffering with Bipolar Disorder it may look like this: big-wave

Now, unless you’re dating Spock, those intense changes in emotion are going to bleed through to every aspect of life and likely cause some tension; even what may seem like trivial things can cause this tension.

For many, empathy does not come naturally or easily. Society has this (in my opinion, irrational) rule that men can’t talk about their emotions. However, you kind of have to talk about emotions to better empathize with someone, there isn’t a way around that; if you want to better understand what someone is going through emotionally, discussing those emotions is inherently necessary. Pushing yourself out of your comfort box generally helps you grow as a person, give it a try, you may find that talking about emotions isn’t as bad as you had once thought.

I stayed in a relationship out of guilt for several months. I felt like it would be selfish of me to end the relationship because she was going through a health issue. I remember a conversation with one of my mentors about it, and he told me to not be a hero, it’s not healthy. Of course, at the time I was convinced that it would be ok, I could be the healthy hero. He was right (mentors generally are). Years later, I was again faced with a situation where I found my significant other facing incredible turbulence. Again, my mentor advised me not to be a hero – things would not end well for either of us. But this time was different, I didn’t feel like I was being a hero; I had real feelings for her and was ready to stand by her and get her through the tough times. Looking back I now acknowledge two vastly different emotional responses. With the first, I wanted to be the hero; I glamorized the idea and thought that it would earn me some brownie points. The second situation, I just wanted to be there for her, out of love, nothing else. Evaluate your feelings; where on the spectrum of those responses do you fall? Regardless of your answer, I’m going to pass on the advice of my mentor; *do not be a hero*.

Being in a romantic relationship with someone who has a mental illness definitely requires special considerations. In many ways, the good times will be better, but know that when the darkness creeps in, your partner will need an emotional rock to cling to until the storm passes. However, do not count out the regular rules of a relationship. While you may have to be there for the person more or extend more patience or empathy than being with someone who isn’t suffering from a mental illness, generally you know in your heart (or soul, or gut, or stomach, or some magical organ that provides emotional clarity) where you want to be.

This whole response probably could have fit on Twitter by removing a couple of words – Communication is key, push yourself to better understand her, don’t be a hero, follow your gut.
