= About Me

== My name is Robert Down,

I am 26 years old and am working towards my Bacheolor of Science in Nursing. Right now I'm in the diagnostic process for [Bipolar Disorder](http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/bipolar-disorder/index.shtml); I've previously been diagnosed with [Dysthymia](http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000918.htm) which was later changed to [Major Depressive Disorder, Severe, Recurrent](http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/depression/index.shtml), and[Generalized Anxiety Disorder](http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/generalized-anxiety-disorder-gad/index.shtml).

One of my coping mechanisms over the years has been to latch on to the idea that my struggles will one day help someone else. I finally came to the conclusion that it was time to put my story out there for the world to hear, with the hope that it will positively impact others who suffer from mental illness and to help paint a picture of what it is like to live with a mental illness for those who do not share my struggles.

It's really no surprise I'm studying psychology, but I'm not sure where my studies will lead. When not studying, I'm an IT consultant, working on web servers, writing code, managing databases, etc., etc. I enjoy photography,  baseball, and cooking.
